# Translation Service

A microservice that provides an API to work with word definitions/translations using Google Translate.

## Features

- Fetch details about a given word including definitions, synonyms, translations, and examples.
- Retrieve a list of words stored in the database with pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities.
- Delete a word from the database.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Setup and Running

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adntgv/translation-service.git
   cd translation-service
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/mydatabase
   REDIS_HOST=cache
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   REDIS_DB=0
   ```

   Note: Adjust the values as needed. You can start off with .env.example file

3. **Build and run the services:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will start the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

4. **Access the API:**

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints

- **Get word details:**

  `GET /word/<word_name>`

- **Get list of words:**

  `GET /words?page=<page_number>&limit=<limit_per_page>&filter=<word_filter>`

- **Delete a word:**

  `DELETE /word/<word_name>`

## Development

To make changes, update the source files in the `app` directory. After making changes, rebuild the Docker images and restart the services.

## Potential Improvements for Translation Service:

1. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for various scenarios like invalid input, database connection failures, external service (Google Translate) failures, etc.
   - Return user-friendly error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.

2. **Logging:**
   - Integrate a logging system to capture and store logs for debugging and monitoring purposes.
   - Consider tools like Logstash or Fluentd for advanced logging.

3. **API Documentation:**
   - Use tools like Swagger to provide interactive API documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and test the endpoints.

4. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Implement a more advanced caching strategy using Redis to reduce the number of calls to the database and external services.
   - Consider cache expiration policies and cache invalidation strategies.

5. **Security:**
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to the API.
   - Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
   - Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other potential vulnerabilities.

6. **Database Optimization:**
   - Implement database indexing for faster query performance.
   - Consider using database connection pooling for efficient database connections.

7. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API.

8. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the health and performance of the service.
   - Set up alerts for any anomalies or failures.

9. **Automated Testing:**
   - Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability of the service.
   - Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

10. **Scalability:**
   - Design the service to be horizontally scalable. Consider using tools like Kubernetes for container orchestration.
   - Optimize the service for load balancing.

11. **Backup and Recovery:**
   - Implement a backup strategy for the database to prevent data loss.
   - Have a recovery plan in place in case of failures.

12. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Use tools like Helm or Kustomize for Kubernetes to manage different environment configurations (e.g., development, staging, production).

13. **Data Privacy:**
   - Ensure that user data is handled with care, especially if storing translations or original texts. Consider GDPR and other data privacy regulations.

14. **Service Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that there's a strategy in place for when dependent services (like Google Translate) change their API or have outages.

15. **Versioning:**
   - Implement API versioning to ensure backward compatibility when introducing breaking changes.
